A set of VIM configurations that I like. You might like them too, if you tried them.

###### PLUGINS: 

* Pathogen, for taking care of loading plugins
* NERDTree, for general project management stuff

###### MAPPINGS:

* jj will press `<ESC>` for you, which is good - that `<ESC>` key is so far away
* `<C-g>` will toggle NERDTree's display
* `<C-hjkl>` move through the various windows you might create on a given day
